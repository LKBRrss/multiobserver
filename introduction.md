On this site we are focusing on the problem of observation. It  is one of the main subjects in the control systems. Works about the question of observation last to date. A lot of people all over the world are trying to figure out the most optimal form of this method.

 We are presenting the one of the recent control theory developments named High Gain Observer. 
This kind of observer has been initiated by works of famous scholars Esfandiari, Khalil, Saberi and Sannuti in 1987-1990. Currently, it is a well studied part of observer theory with many applications. 

The first applied the High Gain Observer was used to control chemical reactors. In 2009 we can find works where the problem of speed observer considering reduced nonlinear model is pursued for sensorless control of induction motors. In 2011, for example,  considered this method  for the operation of SPM machines under saturation.

It is important to know, that the high gain observer is also studied in the context of general application.

Unfortunately this method has obviously drawbacks. One of them is a peaking phenomenon. The problem is related with high gain which yields to impulse transients. It is significant because it there is a possibility of destabilization due to peaking phenomena.

There is a way to allow keep stabillity. It is rely on introduce saturated control. Hence, the peaking obtained in observer does not influence on the controlled plant. But we must remember that the saturated control is not able to remove the peaking from the observer response. Therefore our aim is to challenge an observer transient improvement. 

Our work includes a new structure which may be called multi observer. Here, the problem of indirect adaptive control is solved due identification process which based on many models working simultaneously. That change allows introduce additional adaption law, which makes transients better.

The main idea of High Gain Observer is that structure is modified from single to multi observer. In this case we get two layers: the first is a set of standard High Gain Observers with different estimation states and the second which determines the importance weights of first layer observers. 

Due to these layers we are able to provide additional estimation law. We would like to show the benefits of this kind of method like strategy improved the transient performance and reduced the observer overshoot. This algorithm can be used in every system where High Gain Observer is applicable. To show clearly everything in our work we will focus second order nonlinear system and a magnetic levitation system.
